## ‚ö†Ô∏è MOCK/STATIC DATA (Marketing Pages - Intentional)

### Marketing/Landing Pages
1. **Home.tsx** - ‚ö†Ô∏è Static marketing content
   - Contains hardcoded statistics (2,500+ gyms, 10,000+ users, etc.)
   - These are marketing numbers, not connected to real metrics
   - **Status**: This is intentional marketing content, not functional mock data

2. **Features.tsx** - ‚ö†Ô∏è Static marketing content
   - Hardcoded feature descriptions and benefits
   - Static content for marketing purposes

3. **Testimonials.tsx** - ‚ö†Ô∏è Mock testimonial data
   - Contains hardcoded testimonial array with placeholder images
   - Uses `/api/placeholder/80/80` for customer photos
   - Hardcoded video testimonials with placeholder thumbnails
   - **Status**: Marketing content that should be replaced with real testimonials

4. **Pricing.tsx** - ‚ö†Ô∏è Static pricing with mock testimonials
   - Pricing plans are static (intentional)
   - Contains testimonial section with placeholder images (`/api/placeholder/64/64`)
   - **Status**: Pricing is intentional, but testimonials should be real

5. **GetStarted.tsx** - ‚ö†Ô∏è Static marketing form
   - Form for lead generation (likely connects to real backend)
   - Contains hardcoded business types and features
   - **Status**: Mostly intentional marketing content

   - **Status**: Uses real authentication system

7. **Integrations.tsx** - ‚úÖ Likely real data
   - Simple page that renders integration components
   - Integration components appear to use real API data

## üîç MOCK DATA FOUND IN SPECIFIC COMPONENTS

### Placeholder Images
- **Testimonials.tsx**: Uses `/api/placeholder/80/80` and `/api/placeholder/300/200` for customer photos and video thumbnails
- **Pricing.tsx**: Uses `/api/placeholder/64/64` for testimonial customer photos
- **GetStarted.tsx**: Uses placeholder text for form examples

### Static Marketing Data
- **Home.tsx**: Hardcoded trust indicators and statistics
- **Features.tsx**: Static feature lists and benefits
- **All marketing pages**: Static copy and marketing content

## üìã RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority
1. **Replace testimonial placeholder images** in `Testimonials.tsx` and `Pricing.tsx`
   - Either use real customer photos (with permission) or remove images entirely
   - Consider using initials or default avatars instead

### Medium Priority  
2. **Consider connecting marketing metrics to real data**
   - Home page statistics could be dynamic from real database metrics
   - Would require new database views/queries for aggregate data

### Low Priority
3. **Real testimonials**
   - Replace static testimonial content with customer-submitted testimonials
   - Could build a testimonial management system in the admin area

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSION

**Good News**: All core functional pages (Staff, Payroll, Reports, Settings, Schedule) are using real data from Supabase. The application's main functionality is properly connected to the database.

**Mock Data Remaining**: Only in marketing/landing pages, which is typical and often intentional for showcasing features before users sign up.

**Primary Action Item**: Replace placeholder images in testimonial sections with real photos or remove them entirely.
